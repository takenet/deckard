## Messages


<a name="blipai-deckard-AckRequest"></a>

### AckRequest



| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| id | [string](#string) |  | ID of the message |
| queue | [string](#string) |  | Queue where this message is stored |
| reason | [string](#string) |  | Reason of this result.<br/><br/>Useful for audit, mostly on 'nack' signals. |
| score_subtract | [double](#double) |  | **Deprecated.** This field is deprecated and will be removed in the future. If you need to change the message score, use the 'score' field.<br/><br/>The value to subtract the score and increase final message priority. For example if you want to make this message to have a higher priority you can set 10000 which will represent 10s of score benefit in the default score algorithm. If you want to penalize the message you can send a negative number.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: The message will not be locked by, in the example, 10 seconds. This field is used only to increase or decrease the message priority in the priority queue.<br/><br/>This field is used only for ack requests (since in nack requests the message will return with the lowest score to the queue). It will be ignored if used at the same time of 'score' or 'lock_ms' fields. |
| breakpoint | [string](#string) |  | Breakpoint is a field to be used as an auxiliar field for some specific use cases. For example if you need to keep a record of the last result processing a message, or want to iteract with a pagination system.<br/><br/>Examples: imagine a message representing a web news portal and you want to navigate through the articles. This field could be used to store the last visited article id. Or imagine a message representing a user and you want to iterate through the user's publications pages. This field could be used to store the last page number you visited. |
| lock_ms | [int64](#int64) |  | Time in milliseconds to lock a message before returning it to the queue. For NACK requests the message will be locked before returning to first position in the priority queue. You can change this behavior using the 'score' field.<br/><br/>For ACK requests the message will be locked before returning to last position in the priority queue. You can change this behavior using the 'score' field.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: Deckard checks for locked messages in a 1-second precision meaning the lock have a second precision and not milliseconds. This field is in milliseconds because all duration units on deckard are expressed in milliseconds and the default score algorithm uses milliseconds as well. |
| removeMessage | [bool](#bool) |  | Whether the message should be removed when acked/nacked |
| score | [double](#double) |  | Sets the score of the message when ACKed, to override the default score algorithm.<br/><br/>If used at the same time with the 'lock_ms' attribute, the message will be locked for the specified time and then returned to the queue with the specified score.<br/><br/>For ACK requests, if the score is not provided (or set to 0), the message will return to the queue with the default score algorithm which is the current timestamp in milliseconds.<br/><br/>For NACKs requests, if the score is not provided (or set to 0), the message will return to the queue with the minimum score accepted by Deckard which is 0.<br/><br/>Negative values will be converted to 0, which is how to set the highest priority to a message in a ACK/NACK request.<br/><br/>REMEMBER: the maximum score accepted by Deckard is 9007199254740992 and the minimum is 0, so values outside this range will be capped. |

To set this value to the minimum score accepted by Deckard, use any negative number. This parameter will be ignored if set to 0 (default value). |
| min_score | [double](#double) |  | Sets the lower threshold for the priority score required for a message to be returned. Only messages with a priority score equal to or higher than the min_score value will be returned. The minimum score accepted by Deckard is 0 which is also the default value |

## Google Protobuf Any

The Any type is a special type that can represent any other type.

The Any message type lets you use messages as embedded types without having their .proto definition. 
An Any contains an arbitrary serialized message as bytes, along with a URL that acts as a globally unique identifier for and resolves to that message's type.
