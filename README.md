# Deckard: A Highly Scalable Cyclic Priority Queue

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/takenet/deckard/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=IMT8NWZ69A)](https://codecov.io/gh/takenet/deckard)

Deckard is a priority queue system inspired by projects like: Google Cloud PubSub, Nats, Kafka and others.

![deckard](docs/deckard_cartoon.webp)

The main difference is that Deckard has a priority associated with each message and it is optionally cyclic, meaning that the message can be delivered again after a certain user-managed time.

Briefly:
- An application inserts a message to be queued and its configuration (TTL, metadata, payload, etc).
    - The message will be prioritized with a default timestamp-based algorithm. The priority can also be provided by the application.
- A worker application pull messages from Deckard at regular intervals and performs any processing.
    - When it finishes processing a message, the application must notify with the processing result.
    - When notifying, the application may provide a lock time, to lock the message for a certain duration of time before being requeued and delivered again.
    - It is also possible to notify a message changing its priority.
- When the message's TTL is reached, it stops being delivered;
    - For some use cases the TTL can be set as infinite.
    - An application can also remove the message when notifying.

## Motivation

Deckard was born from an initiative to simplify and unify applications called Frontiers which were part of STILINGUE's orchestration system for data gathering.

Several different implementations were made, but they proved to have several limitations such as:
- Debugging
- Genericity
- Scalability
- Auditability
- Observability
- Prioritization
- Developer friendliness

Deckard was created to solve these problems and to be used in any application that needs to queue data and prioritize it.

The **main** objectives of the project are:
- *Generic*: any data and application should be able to use Deckard to queue messages;
- *Observable*: it should be easy to visualize what happened in a request and easy to investigate problems with audit;
- *Developer friendly*: easy to understand and pleasant to use;
- *Scalable*: it should be possible to support thousands of requests per second and millions of messages;

### **What Deckard is not?**

It is not a normal messaging/queue system. If you don't have a use case that needs priority and cyclic queuing or locking mechanism, you should use GCP PubSub, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Amazon SQS, or any other messaging system.

## Project Status

Deckard has been used in a production environment for over 2 years handling millions of messages and thousands of requests per second.

To be able to open source the project we had to make some changes to the code and that is the reason we opted to release it with a `0.0.x` version.

We also know few issues we need to work but currently we are very confident that it can be used in production environments. Check our [issues](https://github.com/takenet/deckard/issues) to see what we are working on.

Please let us know if you find any issues or have any suggestions in our [discussions](https://github.com/takenet/deckard/discussions).

## Getting Started

A [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started.md) is available to help you to start using Deckard.

Check also the [client documentation](/docs/using.md) to see how to use Deckard in a project using your favorite language.

### Running Deckard

Here's a quick guide on how to run Deckard. You should check the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started.md) for more details.

On `Linux` you can run it from sources with:
```shell
make run
```

You can also run it with Docker:
```shell
docker run --rm -p 8081:8081 blipai/deckard
```

You may also download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/takenet/deckard/releases) page and execute it.

> By default it will use a memory storage and a memory cache engine.
>
> To change the default configuration see the [configuration section](/README.md?#configuration).

## Configuration

We currently use the [viper](github.com/spf13/viper) project to manage configurations and the current implementation delegates the configuration to environment variables.
